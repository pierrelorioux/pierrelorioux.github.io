title: Yallah Tilestream on Raspian !
---

Yesterday I saw a post saying that it would be possible to install node on a Pi. Yallah! I don't know what I'm waiting for to install tilestream and run it on as a local tile server.

Few months ago I installed this superb piece of software on aws. [http://54.77.175.142:8888/](http://54.77.175.142:8888/) It's serving a pretty pink map of beirut !
I found a good tuto here [https://gist.github.com/ccabanero/6451691](https://gist.github.com/ccabanero/6451691)
