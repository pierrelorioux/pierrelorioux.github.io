title: Reading news in csv
---

There is so many news everyday that it's hard for me to keep up. A solution would be to read them as a csv.
[Updated csv of day](https://github.com/GISupportICRC/python_scrapping/blob/master/bbc_world.csv)

It's processed via the rss feed of the BBC. And I update it when I have 5 minutes.
